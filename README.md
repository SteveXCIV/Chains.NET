# Chains.NET

Spice up your enumerables with extra method chains.

## About

This library provides some extra niceties to the `IEnumerable<T>` interface. Many .NET developers enjoy using the standard library features in `System.Linq`. Chains.NET aims to make that experience even better by providing more operations on sequences, inspired by a myriad of functional languages.

*This project is a work-in-progress. One day I hope to be able to offer it on NuGet.*

## FAQ

**Q:** Why "Chains.NET"?

**A:** This libary provides chainable (a.k.a fluent) methods, on top of what LINQ offers, and lots of open source projects in the .NET ecosystem use ".NET" in their name. Finally, as a software engineer, by default I am not good at naming things.
